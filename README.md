At a journalists of color conference in 2004, Gwen Ifill is quoted as saying "I call it the missing white woman search syndrome. If there is a missing white woman, you are going to cover that every day." 18 years later, this statement is still relevant to how our news media covers (or doesn’t cover) women who are murdered or go missing. The disparities in reporting on victims of different racial backgrounds is well researched and thoroughly documented. Despite this, after an extremely high-profile case of a young white woman in September 2021, missing white women syndrome is likely on many people’s radar for the first time. One reason for the lopsided coverage given by the media is that they are simply catering to the interests and expectations of their audience, which prioritizes stories about young, white, privileged, conventionally attractive women. I wanted to know if this is true, and decided to focus on race. To try and find out, I collected responses to recent tweets from the media and public figures about women who are victims of homicide, or go missing, for analysis. My questions are: How *do* we feel about these stories? Do some get more engagement than others? Does the way we talk about them change? My hypothesis was that cases involving white women do indeed garner more attention than ones involving black and indigenous women.
